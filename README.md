# Cardinal

Cardinal is a wrapping of the spectral element code CFD [NekRS](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS) and
the Monte Carlo radiation transport code [OpenMC](https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc) as a MOOSE application.
Cardinal is intended for providing high-resolution thermal-hydraulics
and particle transport feedback to MOOSE multiphysics simulations.
